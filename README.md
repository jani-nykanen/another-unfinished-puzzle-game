## Another unfinished puzzle game

Like the name suggests, this is another unfinished puzzle game. It was supposed to be a simple "Sokoban-like" puzzle game with hundreds of different levels, but after around 30 levels (and numerous bugs), I realized that the lack of originality makes the game very dull to play, so I cancelled the project. But here it is now, fully playable... well, fully playable before the end of level 32, after that the game "crashes".

### Controls

- Arrow keys: move
- Backspace:  undo
- R:          restart\*
- Enter:      pause (you can undo and restart from the pause menu, too)

\* at least on qwerty keyboard


### Known bugs

Undo button does not work well with those toggleable purple blocks
